Remote Garage Door Management System

- This is a home-grown approach to remote access to garage door status and control of open/close.  This came out of necessity for certain houses I've lived at in the past where I frequently would forget if I closed the garage after I left.
- Interface is configurable for who has access to view/control status via the text message interface using the Google Voice API.
- Note that the Google Voice API may have changed since this was last tested, so some tweaking may need to be done.
